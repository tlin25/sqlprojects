# sqlprojects

This repository contains examples of SQL projects that I have worked on using publicly available data to display my thought process and logic when analysing a dataset.

This project portfolio was created in conjunction with my resume to provide evidence to support my practical SQL experience.

Project 1: Tesla Performance - using SQL queries and web research to identify key dates in Tesla historical performance
Project 2: US Customer Complaints - using SQL queries and Power BI to drill into customer complaints and understand the cause for most common complaints, as well as response time.
